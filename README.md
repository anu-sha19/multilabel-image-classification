## Project Overview
This project focuses on multi-label classification with missing labels using a machine learning approach. The goal is to build a model that can classify data points (e.g., images) into multiple categories, while handling cases where some of the true labels are not available during training.

## Introduction

In traditional classification tasks, each data point is assigned a single label. However, in real-world scenarios, data can often belong to multiple categories simultaneously, requiring multi-label classification. This project addresses such a problem, but with an additional challenge: missing labels in the training data.
Our approach aims to effectively train models on incomplete labels and predict the full set of labels for each data point.

## Getting Started 
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **Libraries**: The following libraries should be installed in your Python environment:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your model choice)
  - Matplotlib or Seaborn (for data visualization)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is designed for multi-label classification. Each sample in the dataset has multiple possible labels, but for some samples, certain labels are missing. The dataset consists of:

Input Type: (e.g., images, text)
Number of Classes: [Total number of possible labels]
Sample Size: [Number of data points in the dataset]

###Example of a Data Point 

'''Data Point: Image1
Known Labels: {dog, outdoor}
Missing Labels: {grass, pet} (not available in the training set)'''
